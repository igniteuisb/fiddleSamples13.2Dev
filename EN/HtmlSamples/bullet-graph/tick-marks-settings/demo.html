    A particularly warm winter season reduced natural gas demand in the United States for home heating year-over-year, combined with reduced demand coming from the plastics and petrochemicals industry. May was unusually cool throughout much of the country, which led to unusually higher demand in that month, although weather forecasts anticipate warmer temperatures during the summer and continuing weak demand from industry.
